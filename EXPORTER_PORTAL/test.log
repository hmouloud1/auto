It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality., Content_Body=One of the earliest biographers was Cornelius Nepos, who published his work Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by Plutarch, in his Parallel Lives, published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example the orators Demosthenes and Cicero, or the generals Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is De vita Caesarum ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by Suetonius, written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor Hadrian. 
In the early Middle Ages (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the classical culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the Roman Catholic Church. Hermits, monks, and priests used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the church fathers, martyrs, popes, and saints. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for conversion to Christianity (see Hagiography). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the life of Charlemagne by his courtier Einhard., Page_Contributor=EC#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank, Save_As=Ready for Approval, comment=, Active=TRUE}

Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See Howard Dean and Wesley Clark.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the UK's Labour Party's MP Tom Watson, began to blog to bond with constituents. In January 2005, Fortune magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people "could not ignore": Peter Rojas, Xeni Jardin, Ben Trott, Mena Trott, Jonathan Schwartz, Jason Goldman, Robert Scoble, and Jason Calacanis.[26], Content_Body=Individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on specific topic, product or service and provide combined view for its readers. This allows readers to concentrate on reading instead of searching for quality on-topic content and managing subscriptions.

Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic, Content_Body=The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments., Page_Contributor=EC#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank, Save_As=Ready for Approval, comment=, Active=TRUE}

A more modern equivalent has been the "###" symbol. In other countries, other means of indicating the end of the release may be used, such as the text "ends".
As the Internet has assumed growing prominence in the news cycle, press release writing styles have evolved. Editors of online newsletters, for instance, often lack the staff to convert traditional press release prose into print-ready copy., Content_Body=In the traditional distribution model, the business, political campaign, or other entity releasing information to the media hires a publicity agency to write and distribute written information to the newswires.[6] The newswire then disseminates the information as it is received or as investigated by a journalist. 
An alternative is the self-published press release. In this approach, press releases are either sent directly to local newspapers or to free and paid distribution services.[7] The distribution service then provides the content, as-is, to their media outlets for publication which is usually online., Page_Contributor=EC#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank, Save_As=Ready for Approval, comment=, Active=TRUE}

A press release is traditionally composed of nine structural elements. Press releases can be delivered to members of the media both physically and electronically., Content_Body=Press release material can benefit media corporations because they help decrease costs and improve the amount of material a firm can output in a certain amount of time. Due to the material being pre-packaged, press releases save journalists time, not only in writing a story, but also the time and money it would have taken to capture the news firsthand.[1] 
Although using a press release can save a company time and money, it constrains the format and style of distributed media. In the digital age, consumers want to get their information instantly which puts pressure on the news media to output as much material as possible. This may cause news media companies to heavily rely on press releases in order to create stories., Page_Contributor=EC#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank, Save_As=Ready for Approval, comment=, Active=TRUE}

A service offering defines a level of service for a price: it combines the service (utility) and a service level target (warranty) to bring value to the customer. 

For example, the Calbro IT organization offers different service offerings, or levels, for a email service based on response times. Each service offering costs a different amount based on the service level targets., Content_Body=You can define service offerings based on how you want to manage your services. For example, if managing your services by location is important to your business, you might create the service offerings for Email-US, Email-Europe, and Email-Asia. If managing services by organizations and their resource demands, you might have service offerings for Finance-Small, Finance-Medium, Finance-Large, Support-Medium, and Support-Large to customize for the different storage requirements for each organization. 

In the Service Catalog, you can further define a service offering:
Associate a service offering with a technical service.
Add options to the service offering for end users to select.
All technical and business services must have at least one service offering and can have more than one.
When you create a service level target in the Service Catalog, it does not create a record in nor retrieve data from BMC Service Level Management. For more information, see :, Page_Contributor=EC#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank, Save_As=Ready for Approval, comment=, Active=TRUE}

Such a situation has been noticed among most of the people where regular and dedicated efforts have been ignored and merely the failures have been entertained.

Pohl left in mid-1941 and Super Science Stories was given to Alden H. Norton to edit; a few months later Norton rehired Pohl as an assistant. Popular gave Pohl a very low budget, so most manuscripts submitted to Super Science Stories had already been rejected by the higher-paying magazines. This made it difficult to acquire good fiction, but Pohl was able to acquire stories for the early issues from the Futurians, a group of young science fiction fans and aspiring writers. 
Super Science Stories was an initial success, and within a year Popular increased Pohl's budget slightly, allowing him to pay a bonus rate on occasion. Pohl wrote many stories himself, to fill the magazine and to augment his salary. He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to cease publication of Super Science Stories. The final issue of the first run was dated May of that year. In 1949 the title was revived with Ejler Jakobsson as editor; this version, which included many reprinted stories, lasted almost three years, with the last issue dated August 1951. A Canadian reprint edition of the first run included material from both Super Science Stories and Astonishing Stories; it was unusual in that it published some original fiction rather than just reprints. There were also Canadian and British reprint editions of the second incarnation of the magazine. 
The magazine was never regarded as one of the leading titles of the genre, but has received qualified praise from science fiction critics and historians. Science fiction historian Raymond Thompson describes it as "one of the most interesting magazines to appear during the 1940s", despite the variable quality of the stories.[1] Critics Brian Stableford and Peter Nicholls comment that the magazine "had a greater importance to the history of sf than the quality of its stories would suggest; it was an important training ground, Page_Contributor=EC#GM-CS|Advocacy-Field|World-Bank, Save_As=Ready for Approval, comment=, Active=TRUE}
